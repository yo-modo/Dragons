Dragons
=======

# I wrote Dragon.rb as an expansion on an exercise from Chris Pine's, Learn to Program chapter 9.Classes. It was written as a simpler version of a "Tamagotchi" for me to exercise my new Ruby skills and have something fun to play and interact with. Affectionately named "Norbert", this project is not yet finished.
